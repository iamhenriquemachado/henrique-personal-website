# Building Scalable Web Applications with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building web applications. Its server-side rendering capabilities, automatic code splitting, and built-in optimizations make it an excellent choice for building scalable applications.

## Server Components

React Server Components are a new way to build React applications that leverage the server to improve performance. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.

```jsx
// This component is rendered on the server
export default async function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const user = await fetchUser(userId);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
